Prayer to Drukpa Kunley
by Trulshik Adeu Rinpoche

dü sum gyalwé yeshe dzutrul gar
Magical dance of the wisdom of the victorious ones of the three times,
duljé gön du shiri heruké
Manifesting in the form of a Śrī Heruka,
nampar rolpa drubpé chimé chok
Protector of beings to be trained and supreme progenitor of siddhas—
künga lekpé shyab la solwa deb
Kunga Lekpa, at your feet I pray:
zungdzin nangwa chönyi long drol né
Inspire me to liberate dualistic perception into the dharmatā expanse
lama khyé dang yermé jingyi lob
And remain inseparable from you, the guru.

The one who holds the name of eighth Trulshik wrote this at the request of Tupten Chödzin.
